    <h1>Lazy Sourdough Bread</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Craving a delicious homemade bread but don't want to deal with the hassle of setting timers? Well, this lazy sourdough recipe is perfect for you! I've followed this recipe dozens of times, producing consistently delicious results. Soft on the inside, crunchy on the outside. Once you try this recipe, you'll <em>discard</em> all the others. <strong>Please note, a sourdough starter is required, so follow this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHm1aKxAsIs">link</a> to Brian Lagerstrom's video on how to make one.</strong>
